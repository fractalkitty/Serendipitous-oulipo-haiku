# Serendipitous Oulipo Haiku

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/fractalkitty/pen/ZEvydbK](https://codepen.io/fractalkitty/pen/ZEvydbK).

I copied, pasted, cut, poked, threaded, beaded, coded, and finished Serendipitous Oulipo Haiku. Four hundred and eighteen haiku when rearranged by first, second, and third lines yield 418 x 418 x 418 poems. That is 73,034,632 haiku that often work, sometimes seem profound, and other times are broken thoughts. I added a single poem, serendipity, for this project to the 417 haiku from the past 14 months.  

I could go into the parallels of three lines and the Three Princes of Serendip or the potential within myself and of this earth reflected in the potential literature (Oulipo), or the temporary sand-like nature that each poem feels like, but I won't. I want you, the viewer/maker/reader, to find the poems that speak to you; the poetry that is serendipitous for who you are in this space and time. Serendipity only happens with action - poems only become when written.
