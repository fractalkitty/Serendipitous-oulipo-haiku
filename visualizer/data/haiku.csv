we are all so close,to the heights that we desire,just remove the load
the most open paths,may be the wettest or tough,but they will have light
"oh, yes, this is it!",completely immerse yourself,in the day’s raindrops
you root yourself deep,while reaching over a stream,of utter delight
my luck dragon came,to remind me — dream of sky,all that is above
we run the same paths,and yet we experience,such different days
some of these rivers,swiftly move with such volume,depth has no meaning
I treat my tea bag,like it is the very last,tied for each refill
this colorful mist,brings me in and out of the,focus of this path
however I tread,may it be quiet and soft,as though I am not
your entire self — world,is but a dew drop of sky,"clay, and ev’rything"
oh my bald cypress,you have shed for the season,"now, take in more light"
sometimes it’s the clouds,that provide the light you seek,in dark winter days
you gather right there,ready to coalesce — one,puddle of raindrops
The structure of you,is beyond understanding,beautiful — complex
it is like you stand,always reaching to the west,waiting for sunset
I saw you today,in the window made by rain,whispering of love
I picture myself,merging with the trees and leaves,not just in shadow
stopped my class today,so they could all see this bird,summer tanager
I write this for you,a permission slip to be,the person you are
your consistency,does humble me to this earth,a night reflection
I found you — fallen,glorious touching the earth,while reflecting sky
I keep company,that demands sugary treats,and announces life
I could write more than,a thousand poems of you,and still fall so short
reflections at sea,lead you to this perspective,earth and sky as one
a puddle can seem,to be a portal of sky,cradled by the Earth
just look at you there,"playing in the waves, currents",and eddies of life
you need solitude,to truly reflect on you,at the lowest tide
you are a symbol,"for being steadfast, constant",no matter the seas
you reach down into,the depths of the light and dark,to root yourself in
we all need this path,a trail to be hopped and skipped,to bring us to youth
I think that you might,reach with your iterations,for a sunlit hug
I need to walk there,in that space — sans time — sans thought,to truly exist
you just might feel it,an ancient forest of life,that is now but grass

in the sky — a sign,greater than Saturn — painted,as the darkness came
this night sky that comes,earlier now. Lets us know,our place in the stars
little winter bee,on the rosemary and frost,gather energy
we all cling sometimes,to a season that has passed,not ready to go
my road is the path,"of light and shadow, those lines",in the winter sun
as you look down here,at the leaves that you have lost,remember the sky
you take off and fly,when the wind whispers to you,that it is now time
there are these comets,that have tails pointing ahead,to the vast beyond
"even planets, stars",can become tangled in lines,of aether and light
you’re my paradox,coastline measured by atom,finite — infinite
"oh, oyster catcher",do seek out that which blends in,bring us forth those pearls
a light of guidance,does not point its beam at you,"instead, it drops hints"
the clouds and the sea,pull me to that single point,a focus within
there exists nothing,like the sound of waves pulling,cobbles at high tide
just make sure that you,seize those moments that make you,utterly alive
be the horizon,grab the celestial light,at your ocean’s edge
I see sentinels,they guard their posts — stand ready,in hopes of french fries
dive deep into waves,and find they are but water,connected to Earth
I saw the blue mass,of this precious blue planet,leap up to kiss sky
a vector on wind,with the magnitude of life,direction of change
imagine being,that crest of water — a wave,that just catches light
so many curves here,"arcs of me, of time — being",the universe rounds
grab the sky and loam,place them in your mind’s pocket,to have them always
dim the light with fog,so you can hear the whispers,of what surrounds you
to connect with you,I will reach with all my time,for it’s what I have
the muddy puddles,can reflect heavenly light,you just have to look
your little footprints,"fill my soul with joy, love. In",this brief existence
a flurry of white,swirls in your radiant light,calling you to dance
you anticipate,that your trail will not be full,of water and ducks
"there you are, my hawk",contemplating reflection,in this little pond
your path can be framed,with the steel beams of your thoughts,to bridge within you
some windows are but,fractals into more windows,iterated views
I glanced at you — there,an impetus for your flight,to gossip of this
"oh, how you long to",break free from these tangled limbs,to be swept by wind

a forest of ferns,upon a forest by sea,modest are the trees

when you miss the moon,just keep going — it is but,a sign on your way
the elk must have left,just before this headland warmed,with the morning’s grace
bubbles have been packed,on the surface of the depths,of my consciousness
you harbor beauty,in your layers as they fall,off of you in age
an aperture formed,to manifest silver clouds,at the lowest point
somehow blooms do form,from life that I did not know,was so capable
it’s best not to see,too far ahead of your path,look at what’s in reach
the currents of geese,flow through the ocean of sky,bringing waves of north
just for a moment,I thought you might sit with me,and talk of the birds
of growth and decay,to journey beneath the stars,unconstrained by thought
breadcrumbs of sunbeams,lead you to the horizon,of an inner light
companion within,together in solitude,at the shore of soul
a tide of forest,echoes with branches in streams,temporal beings
even in our death,we may spring forth foliage,out of what remains
what seems like chaos,might be — organized — perfect,beyond what we grasp
I think that you must,run your fingers through this sand,to find what is deep
could this day just be,painted for you — offering,a breath of color
shoes of sand and moss,cushion your steps as you run,joyfully alive
"now, lessen yourself",below the grasses of thought,be in quiet awe
your life has texture,of earth and aether — of self,and empty of self
you play when hidden,converse in intimate joy,‘fore you fly away
shadows stretch across,the dunes of me — parallel,conforming to curve
separate you stand,in an ocean of currents,glorious — alone
I see this window,"it appears, just at my feet",of another Earth
reminders of love,sprout from every atom,of this universe
little hummingbird,be the leaf on winter’s tree,and sing of the spring
thank you my river,for receding from my path,so that I may flow
I feel the evening,approach ing— and yet you’re here,to tuck me in — dream
messengers of trees,whisper of white oaks and fir,of growth and decay
you drape down – from up,almost as if you desire,heaven and the Earth
the most shadowed trail,will still have footsteps of light,contrast on our path
there are these night skies,that make you feel like you’re on,another planet
Earth has silhouettes,"infinite, ever-changing",possibilities
sing to the kitties,when you enter the forest,that stands still and dark
this junction of ray,and your fractal being – now,goes – as you orbit
I know this portal,locked within is history,I have passed this past
I am sorry friend,that you stand alone out here,I will sit with you
thirty little squares,make this icosahedron,origami joy
"so, obviously",you have been trained to lure us,with your fluff and stance
you have the widest,reach with those ancient branches,forest holding hands
this small white primrose,whispered to my deepest self,of growth beneath soil
I folded this crane,to put a thought of peace here,and then held my breath
on a walkabout,pause to see the warp and weft,of life around you
your little hands here,hold what is precious and clear,to the morning beams
when you are present,ev’ryone becomes silent,until you take flight
there is no limit,for the number of poems,to this small flower
"and so, here I am",in the rain beneath this sky,drops encompass me
